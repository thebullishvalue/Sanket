Sanket — Shared CSS, chart theming, and colour constants for the UI layer.
संकेत (Sanketa) — "Signal · Indicator · Forewarning"

UI — Institutional research terminal design language, adopted wholesale from
Tattva. These two are the same product family; a reader moving between them
should not have to relearn what a panel, a chip or a number looks like.

Aesthetic: "Graphite" — near-achromatic ground, semantic colour only
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- Display/UI:  Inter (prose, headings, labels)
- Body/Data:   JetBrains Mono (tabular numerals — every figure in the app)
- Ground:      Graphite (#0A0C10 -> #1C212A), deliberately neutral. The
               previous ramp was a saturated navy under an amber-gold accent,
               which tinted every panel and forced the semantic hues to shout
               over an already-coloured field.
- Semantic:    Cobalt #4C7DF0 (interactive), Green #2CA36B (long),
               Red #DD5A5A (short), Amber #D79A3C (caution ONLY),
               Steel #4E9FC4 (info). Muted, not the stock Tailwind-500 ramp;
               each clears WCAG AA on every surface it is used on.
- Surfaces:    Flat, told apart by a hairline border and one step of tone.
               No blur, no stacked shadows — a shadow is spent on overlays.
- Themes:      Slate (dark) and Paper (light, for reading and print). The
               light theme is a token swap, not a second stylesheet — see
               LIGHT_TOKENS below.

AMBER IS NO LONGER THE BRAND. Sanket's previous system made amber-gold the
product accent and also its caution colour, so "this is Sanket" and "be
careful" were the same signal. Amber now means caution and nothing else;
cobalt carries interaction.
